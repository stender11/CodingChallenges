// ---Instructions:---
// You have to write a function that describe Leo:
// function leo(oscar) {
// }
// if oscar was (integer) 88, you have to return "Leo finally won the oscar! Leo is happy".
// if oscar was 86, you have to return "Not even for Wolf of wallstreet?!"
// if it was not 88 or 86 (and below 88) you should return "When will you give Leo an Oscar?"
// if it was over 88 you should return "Leo got one already!"

// ---Submitted Solution:---
function leo(oscar) {
    if (oscar === 86) {
        return "Not even for Wolf of wallstreet?!"
    } else if (oscar === 88) {
        return "Leo finally won the oscar! Leo is happy"
    } else if (oscar > 88) {
        return "Leo got one already!"
    } else {
        return "When will you give Leo an Oscar?"
    }
}

// ---Test cases:---
console.log(leo(89)) // "Leo got one already!"
console.log(leo(88)) // "Leo finally won the oscar! Leo is happy"
console.log(leo(87)) // "When will you give Leo an Oscar?"
console.log(leo(86)) // "Not even for Wolf of wallstreet?!"
